# Project future
I (loganmc10) have decided to focus my future efforts on a new N64 emulator (https://github.com/gopher64/gopher64). Please try it out! This project has been archived and development has stopped. If Gopher64 doesn't have a feature that you are interested in, [RMG](https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG) is another very good emulator based on mupen64plus.
